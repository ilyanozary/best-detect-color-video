# Able to detect blue color in all conditions:

This algorithm is able to detect blue color objects in images with high accuracy. It uses OpenCV library functions to achieve robust blue color detection without machine learning techniques. The algorithm has been trained on a large dataset of images containing different blue objects in various environments and lighting conditions. It can differentiate between different shades of blue and distinguish blue from purple color. The algorithm performs well in both indoor and outdoor scenes with different lighting, achieving good detection results under direct sunlight, shadows and artificial lights. The code is well-documented and comes with examples to help others learn and build upon this work. Overall, this project demonstrates an effective approach for detecting blue color in images using traditional computer vision techniques.
